## Minor Issues (Non-Blocking) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Console-Only Logging for DirectSound Switch
**Severity:** Low
**Affected Applications:** veleron_voice_flow.py, veleron_dictation.py, veleron_dictation_v2.py

**Description:**
When the application automatically switches to DirectSound API for USB device compatibility, the notification is only visible in the console output, not in the GUI.

**Impact:**
- Users won't see visual confirmation when DirectSound activates
- Advanced users must check console logs to verify DirectSound switch
- No functional impact (DirectSound still works correctly)

**Console Output Example:**
```
[INFO] Current selection: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) (ID: 12, API: Windows WASAPI)
[INFO] SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND: Using device ID 6 (Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)) instead of 12
```

**Workaround:**
- Run application from command prompt to see console logs
- For veleron_voice_flow.py: Check log panel in GUI (may show logs)
- For veleron_dictation.py and veleron_dictation_v2.py: Launch from .bat file to keep console visible

**Planned Fix:**
- Add GUI notification toast when DirectSound activates
- Add status bar indicator showing current audio API
- Include in future release (post-MVP)

### 2. Mono Recording Forced
**Severity:** Low
**Affected Applications:** veleron_voice_flow.py, veleron_dictation.py, veleron_dictation_v2.py

**Description:**
All recordings are forced to mono (single channel), even when using stereo-capable microphones. The recording logic uses `channels=1` parameter.

**Code Location:**
```python
# veleron_voice_flow.py line ~600
with sd.InputStream(device=device_spec, samplerate=16000, channels=1, dtype='float32') as stream:
```

**Impact:**
- Stereo devices are downmixed to mono
- Loss of spatial audio information
- Not ideal for music transcription

**Reasoning:**
- Voice transcription doesn't benefit from stereo
- Mono reduces file size and processing time
- Maximum compatibility across device types
- Whisper models are optimized for mono voice audio

**Workaround:**
- None needed for voice transcription (mono is sufficient)
- For music or spatial audio, consider using stereo-capable transcription software

**Planned Fix:**
- Add stereo recording option in settings
- Allow user to choose mono vs stereo
- Include in future release (post-MVP)

---

### 3. No Device Testing Feature
**Severity:** Low
**Affected Applications:** veleron_voice_flow.py, veleron_dictation_v2.py

**Description:**
Users cannot test their microphone before starting a recording session. There's no "Test Microphone" button to verify device is working correctly.

**Impact:**
- Users must start recording to verify microphone works
- Wastes time if device isn't working properly
- No visual feedback for microphone levels

**Workaround:**
1. Use Windows Sound Settings to test microphone:
   - Open Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Input
   - Speak into microphone
   - Watch for green bars indicating audio levels

2. Use short test recording:
   - Start recording briefly (5 seconds)
   - Stop and check transcription
   - Verify device is working before longer recordings

**Planned Fix:**
- Add "Test Microphone" button in GUI
- Display real-time audio level meter
- Show visual feedback when speaking
- Include in future release (post-MVP)

---

### 4. No Real-time Transcription Display
**Severity:** Medium
**Affected Applications:** veleron_voice_flow.py, veleron_dictation.py, veleron_dictation_v2.py

**Description:**
Transcription results appear only after recording completes. There's no real-time display of transcription progress during recording.

**Impact:**
- Users must wait until recording finishes to see results
- No immediate feedback if transcription quality is poor
- Cannot adjust speaking style mid-recording

**Technical Reason:**
- Whisper processes audio in 30-second windows
- Full file processing provides better accuracy
- Real-time transcription requires different architecture

**Workaround:**
- Use shorter recording sessions (30-60 seconds)
- Review transcription quality and adjust speaking style for next recording
- Use "turbo" model for faster processing

**Planned Fix:**
- Implement streaming transcription mode
- Display partial results as they become available
- Add real-time transcription confidence indicator
- Requires significant architectural changes (future release)

## Limitations üìã

### Application Limitations

1. **No Manual API Selection**
   - Cannot manually choose between WASAPI and DirectSound
   - Automatic fallback decides which API to use
   - Future: Add advanced settings for manual API selection

2. **No Multi-Language Auto-Detection Mid-Recording**
   - Language must be selected before recording
   - Cannot detect language switches mid-recording
   - Workaround: Select "auto" for language detection or choose specific language

3. **No Custom Punctuation Models**
   - Uses Whisper's default punctuation
   - Cannot train custom punctuation for specific domains
   - Workaround: Post-process text for domain-specific punctuation

4. **No Background Noise Reduction**
   - Application doesn't apply noise filtering
   - Relies on Whisper's built-in noise tolerance
   - Workaround: Record in quiet environment or use external noise cancellation

5. **No Performance Profiling Tools**
   - Startup time, latency, and transcription time not tracked
   - Cannot identify performance bottlenecks easily
   - Future: Add performance monitoring dashboard

### Hardware Limitations

6. **USB Hub Compatibility**
   - Some USB hubs may cause device detection issues
   - Recommendation: Connect devices directly to USB ports
   - Workaround: Use powered USB hubs if direct connection unavailable

7. **Bluetooth Latency**
   - Bluetooth headsets may have slight audio delay
   - Does not affect transcription quality, only real-time monitoring
   - Workaround: Use wired devices for lowest latency

### Model Limitations

8. **Model Download Size**
   - Models range from 39M (tiny) to 1550M (large)
   - Large models require significant disk space and VRAM
   - Workaround: Use smaller models (turbo, medium) for most use cases

9. **Processing Speed**
   - Large models are slower (up to 10x slower than tiny)
   - Processing time depends on audio length
   - Workaround: Use "turbo" model for speed, "medium" for balance
