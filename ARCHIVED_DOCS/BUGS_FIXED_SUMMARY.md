If transcription says "[No speech detected]", you might need to:
- Speak louder or closer to mic
- Check microphone isn't muted
- Verify correct input device selected in Windows

### Tip #4: Model Selection
- **"tiny"** = Fastest, less accurate
- **"base"** = Good balance (default)
- **"small"** = Better accuracy, slower
- **"medium/large"** = Best accuracy, much slower
