## üéØ YOUR NEXT 3 ACTIONS (30 Minutes)

### Action 1: Read These 2 Files (15 minutes)

**Priority 1:** [MVP_COMPLETION_REPORT.md](MVP_COMPLETION_REPORT.md)
- Complete sprint results
- All deliverables summary
- Next steps detailed

**Priority 2:** [ORCHESTRATION_SUMMARY.md](ORCHESTRATION_SUMMARY.md)
- How the orchestration worked
- Subagent results
- Metrics and status

### Action 2: Run Your First Test (5 minutes)

Open PowerShell in the project directory and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "c:\Users\noelj\Projects\Veleron Dev Studios\Applications\whisper"

# Install test dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock

# Run a single quick test to verify everything works
pytest tests/test_whisper_to_office.py::TestTimestampFormatting::test_format_timestamp_seconds_only -v

# Expected: Test should PASS ‚úÖ
```

**If this test passes, your testing infrastructure is working! üéâ**

### Action 3: Run Full Test Suite (10 minutes)

```powershell
# Run all automated tests with coverage report
pytest -m "not manual" -v --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# This will:
# - Run ~230 automated tests
# - Generate coverage report
# - Open results in browser
# - Take 2-5 minutes to complete

# Expected result: Most/all tests should pass
# Coverage report will open at: htmlcov/index.html
```
