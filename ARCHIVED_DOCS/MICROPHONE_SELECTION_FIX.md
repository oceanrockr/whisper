# üé§ Microphone Selection Feature Added!
**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Ready to Test

---

## üêõ The Problem

You reported that when trying to use the **C922 Pro Stream Webcam** microphone, the application wasn't activating it - no light on the webcam, indicating it wasn't being used.

**Root Cause:** The application was only using the system's default microphone and had no way to select a different input device.

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

I've added a **Microphone Selection Dropdown** to the application!

### New Features Added:

1. **Automatic Device Detection**
   - Scans all audio input devices at startup
   - Displays them in an easy-to-use dropdown
   - Shows device ID and name for each microphone

2. **Microphone Selection Dropdown**
   - Located in the Controls panel, second row
   - Shows all available input devices
   - Lets you choose which microphone to use
   - Updates immediately when changed

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Logs which device is being used for recording
   - Shows device detection in console
   - Helps troubleshoot device issues

4. **Better Error Messages**
   - If recording fails, suggests trying different microphone
   - Shows device ID in error logs

---

## üìç Where to Find It

**In the Application Window:**
```
Controls Panel:
Row 1: [üé§ Start Recording] [üìÅ Transcribe File]  Model: [base ‚ñº]
Row 2: Language: [auto ‚ñº]  Microphone: [1: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Web... ‚ñº]
                                        ‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë NEW DROPDOWN HERE! ‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë
```

## üöÄ How to Test

### Step 1: Launch the Application

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\noelj\Projects\Veleron Dev Studios\Applications\whisper"
py veleron_voice_flow.py
```

### Step 2: Check Console Output

Look for device detection messages:
```
[INFO] Scanning for audio input devices...

[INFO] Default input device: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Web (ID: 1)
[INFO] Found 7 input devices total
```

‚úÖ You should see your C922 webcam listed multiple times (different audio APIs)

### Step 3: Select Your C922 Microphone

In the application window:
1. Look for the **"Microphone:"** dropdown (second row, right side)
2. Click the dropdown arrow ‚ñº
3. You'll see options like:

   12: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)
   13: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)
   ```
4. **Select one** (I recommend trying **Device 12** first - that's WASAPI)

**In the console, you'll see:**
```
[INFO] Microphone changed to: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) (ID: 12)
```

### Step 4: Test Recording

1. **Click "üé§ Start Recording"**
   - **Watch your webcam!** The light should turn on! üí°
   - Console shows: `[INFO] Recording from device 12: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)`
   - Status bar shows: "Recording... Speak now"

2. **Speak clearly for 5-10 seconds**

3. **Click "‚èπ Stop Recording"**
   - Webcam light should turn off
   - Application processes and transcribes

4. **Check transcription appears**

## üîç Understanding Your C922 Options

Your C922 Pro Stream Webcam appears **4 times** in the device list because Windows provides different audio APIs:

| Device ID | Name | API | Best For |
|-----------|------|-----|----------|
| **1** | Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Web | **MME** | Basic use, most compatible |
| **6** | Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) | **DirectSound** | Games, older apps |
| **12** | Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) | **WASAPI** | **‚≠ê RECOMMENDED** - Low latency, high quality |
| **13** | Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) | **WDM-KS** | Professional audio, lowest latency |

### üí° Recommendation: Try Device 12 (WASAPI)

**WASAPI** is the modern Windows audio API and usually works best:
- Lower latency
- Better quality
- More reliable
- Native Windows 10/11 support

**If Device 12 doesn't work, try Device 1 (MME) - most compatible**

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### When Recording is Active ‚úÖ

**Physical Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Webcam LED light turns **ON** (blue/white light)
- ‚úÖ Status bar shows "Recording... Speak now"
- ‚úÖ Record button text changes to "‚èπ Stop Recording"

**In Console:**
```
[INFO] Starting recording...
[INFO] Recording from device 12: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)
```

**In Windows:**
- You might see microphone activity indicator in system tray
- Audio settings may show the device as "in use"

### When Recording Stops ‚úÖ

**Physical Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Webcam LED light turns **OFF**
- ‚úÖ Status bar shows "Processing audio..."
- ‚úÖ Progress bar animates
- ‚úÖ Transcription appears in text area

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webcam Light Still Doesn't Turn On

**Try each of these:**

1. **Try Different Device IDs**
   ```
   Try in this order:
   1. Device 12 (WASAPI)
   2. Device 1 (MME)
   3. Device 6 (DirectSound)
   4. Device 13 (WDM-KS)
   ```

2. **Check Windows Permissions**
   - Windows Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone
   - Ensure Python/your app has microphone access
   - Ensure C922 is enabled

3. **Check Device Manager**
   - Open Device Manager (Win+X ‚Üí Device Manager)
   - Expand "Audio inputs and outputs"
   - Look for "Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)"
   - Ensure it's **enabled** (not disabled)
   - Right-click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí check status

4. **Test in Another App**
   - Open Windows Sound Recorder or Voice Recorder
   - Select C922 microphone
   - Does the light turn on there?
   - If not, this is a system/driver issue

5. **Check Logs**
   - Click "View Logs" button in app
   - Look for "Recording from device X: ..."
   - Check for any error messages

### Issue: Recording Error

**If you get an error:**
1. Click "View Logs" button
2. Look for the error message
3. Try a different device ID from the dropdown

**Common Error:**
```
[ERROR] Recording error: Device unavailable
```
**Solution:** Try a different device ID (the same mic has 4 options)

### Issue: Webcam Light Turns On But No Audio

**This means the recording IS working!**

The issue might be:
1. **Speaking too quietly** - Speak louder/closer
2. **Room is too quiet** - Whisper detects no speech
3. **Wrong sample rate** - Try device 12 (WASAPI)

**Test:**
- Record for 5-10 seconds
- Speak clearly and loudly: "Testing one two three"
- Watch the console for audio processing logs

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip #1: Save Your Device Selection
Unfortunately, the app doesn't save your selection yet. Each time you restart, you'll need to select your C922 again. *This could be a future enhancement!*

### Tip #2: Test Multiple Devices
If one device ID doesn't work well:
- Try the others!
- Device 12 (WASAPI) usually works best
- But Device 1 (MME) is most compatible

### Tip #3: Check the LED
The webcam LED is the best indicator:
- **LED ON** = Device is being used ‚úÖ
- **LED OFF** = Device not active or wrong device selected ‚ùå

### Tip #4: Audio Quality
Different APIs may have different audio quality:
- **WASAPI (12)** = Best quality, low latency
- **MME (1)** = Good compatibility, decent quality
- **DirectSound (6)** = Gaming, good quality
- **WDM-KS (13)** = Professional, lowest latency but may need admin

### Tip #5: Use View Logs
If anything doesn't work:
1. Click "View Logs"
2. Look for device-related messages
3. Check which device is actually being used
4. Look for any error messages
