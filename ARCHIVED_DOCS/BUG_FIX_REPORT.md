# Bug Fix Report - Veleron Voice Flow
**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Issues:** WinError 2 - File not found errors during recording

---

## üêõ Bugs Identified

### Bug #1: WinError 2 - The system cannot find the file specified
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Component:** veleron_voice_flow.py
**Trigger:** Clicking "Hold to Record" green button

**Root Cause:**
1. **ffmpeg not accessible in current shell session** - The `setx PATH` command only affects NEW shell sessions, not the current one
2. **Whisper internally calls ffmpeg** to decode audio files
3. **Limited error visibility** - No console logging for debugging

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Runtime ffmpeg PATH Detection & Configuration

**Changes:**
- Added `check_ffmpeg()` method that runs at startup
- Searches common ffmpeg installation paths:
  - `C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin`
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\ffmpeg\bin`
  - `C:\ffmpeg\bin`
  - `~\ffmpeg\bin` (user directory)
- **Automatically adds ffmpeg to PATH** for current process using `os.environ["PATH"]`
- Works immediately without requiring shell restart

**Code Location:** Lines 68-100 in veleron_voice_flow_fixed.py

```python
def check_ffmpeg(self):
    """Check if ffmpeg is available and add to PATH if needed"""
    # ... searches and adds ffmpeg to PATH for current session
```

### Fix #2: Enhanced Error Handling & Logging

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive logging system with timestamps
- All operations logged to internal buffer
- **New "View Logs" button** in UI to see detailed error messages
- Console output for debugging
- Detailed error messages for every operation

**Code Location:**
- Lines 59-67: Logging setup
- Lines 237-248: Log viewer window
- Throughout: Logging calls at every critical operation

### Fix #3: Better Temporary File Handling

**Changes:**
- Explicit temp file naming with timestamps
- Better error messages when temp file operations fail
- Proper cleanup with error handling
- Detailed logging of temp file paths and sizes

**Code Location:** Lines 335-395 in transcribe_recording()

### Fix #4: Improved Error Messages

**Changes:**
- User-friendly error dialogs
- Suggestion to click "View Logs" for details
- Status bar shows clear error states
- Console output for technical details

## üìã How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Version (Recommended)

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\noelj\Projects\Veleron Dev Studios\Applications\whisper"

# Rename original (backup)
ren veleron_voice_flow.py veleron_voice_flow_backup.py

# Rename fixed version to original name
ren veleron_voice_flow_fixed.py veleron_voice_flow.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Restart

If you've already run `setx PATH`, simply:
1. Close the current application
2. Close the PowerShell/terminal
3. Open a NEW PowerShell/terminal
4. Run the application again

The ffmpeg PATH will now be available.

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Verify ffmpeg Detection

```powershell
# Run the fixed version
py veleron_voice_flow_fixed.py
```

**Expected Console Output:**
```
============================================================
Veleron Voice Flow - Starting Application
============================================================
Python version: 3.13.7 ...
Current directory: ...
Temp directory: C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp
============================================================
[2025-10-12 ...] [INFO] Checking ffmpeg availability...
[2025-10-12 ...] [INFO] Found ffmpeg at: C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin
[2025-10-12 ...] [INFO] Added C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin to PATH for this session
```

### Test 2: Record Audio

1. Click "üé§ Start Recording"
2. Speak for 5 seconds
3. Click "‚èπ Stop Recording"
4. Watch status bar for progress
5. If error occurs, click "View Logs" button

**Expected Behavior:**
- Status should show "Recording... Speak now"
- Then "Processing audio..."
- Then "Transcription complete"
- Transcription appears in text area

### Test 3: View Logs

1. Click "View Logs" button
2. Review all operations
3. Check for any ERROR or WARNING messages

---

## üîç Debugging Guide

### If Recording Still Fails

1. **Click "View Logs" button** in the application
2. Look for these log entries:
   - `[INFO] Checking ffmpeg availability...`
   - `[INFO] Found ffmpeg at: ...` (should see a path)
   - `[INFO] Starting recording...`
   - `[INFO] Recording audio from microphone...`

3. **Check for ERROR messages:**
   - `[ERROR] Error during transcription: ...`
   - This will tell you the exact problem

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "WARNING: ffmpeg not found"
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Verify ffmpeg exists
dir "C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe"

# If not found, reinstall ffmpeg
# Or update the path in check_ffmpeg() method
```

#### Issue: "Recording error: ..."
**Solution:** Check microphone permissions and device

```powershell
# Test microphone access
py -c "import sounddevice as sd; print(sd.query_devices())"
```

#### Issue: "No audio recorded"
**Solution:**
- Speak louder/closer to microphone
- Check microphone is not muted
- Select correct input device in Windows settings
