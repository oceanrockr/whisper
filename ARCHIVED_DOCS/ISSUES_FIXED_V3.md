## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Fix #1: Smart Device Deduplication ✅

**What Changed:**
- Devices are now **deduplicated by name**
- **Only ONE entry per physical device** shown in dropdown
- **Automatically selects WASAPI** version (best quality API)
- Shows API name in parentheses: "Device Name (WASAPI)"

**Priority System:**
1. 🥇 **WASAPI** (Windows Audio Session API) - Modern, low latency
2. 🥈 **DirectSound** - Gaming, good compatibility
3. 🥉 **MME** (Multimedia Extensions) - Legacy, most compatible
4. ⚪ **WDM-KS** (Kernel Streaming) - Professional, may need admin

**Before Fix:**
```
1: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Web
6: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)
12: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)
13: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)
18: Headset (Josh's Buds3 Pro)
```

**After Fix:**
```
12: Microphone (C922 Pro Str... (WASAPI)
18: Headset (Josh's Buds3 Pro) (WDM-KS)
```

✅ **Much cleaner! Only 1 entry per device, automatically using best API!**

### Fix #2: Live Device Refresh Button ✅

**What Changed:**
- Added **"🔄 Refresh" button** next to microphone dropdown
- Click to **scan for new devices** without restarting app
- **Detects hot-plugged devices** (USB mics, Bluetooth headsets, webcams)
- **Preserves your selection** if device still connected
- Updates dropdown in real-time

**How to Use:**
1. Connect your Wireless Buds Pro 3
2. Click "🔄 Refresh" button in the app
3. **Device appears in dropdown immediately!**
4. Select it and start recording

**Console Output:**
```
[INFO] Refreshing audio device list...
[INFO] Scanning for audio input devices...
[INFO] Found input device 18: Headset (Josh's Buds3 Pro) (Windows WDM-KS, 1 channels)
[INFO] Found 2 unique input devices (after deduplication)
[INFO] Device refresh complete - 2 devices found
```

### Fix #3: C922 Webcam LED Investigation 🔍

**Diagnosis:**
The LED not lighting up could be due to several reasons:

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Windows is blocking camera LED** (webcam LED tied to video, not audio)
2. **Using wrong device ID** after deduplication
3. **Sample rate mismatch** (webcam expects different sample rate)
4. **Driver issue** (C922 audio driver)
5. **Windows privacy settings** blocking microphone access

**Testing Steps Added:**

I've added enhanced logging to help diagnose:
- Logs which device ID is being used
- Logs the API name (WASAPI, DirectSound, etc.)
- Logs when recording starts/stops
- Shows any status messages from audio device

**What to Try:**

1. **After launching updated app, check console:**
   ```
   [INFO] Found input device 12: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) (Windows WASAPI, 2 channels)
   ```

2. **Select the C922 from dropdown** - it should now say:
   ```
   12: Microphone (C922 Pro Str... (WASAPI)
   ```

3. **Start recording and check console:**
   ```
   [INFO] Recording from device 12: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) (Windows WASAPI)
   ```

4. **Watch for any warnings/errors**

**Webcam LED Note:**
⚠️ **Important:** Many webcam LEDs are tied to the **camera (video)**, not the **microphone (audio)**. The C922 LED might only turn on when using the **camera**, not just the microphone.

**To test if audio is working:**
- Record for 10 seconds
- Speak clearly
- Check if transcription appears
- If transcription works, **audio is being captured even if LED doesn't light**

**Alternative Test:**
- Open Windows "Sound Settings"
- Go to "Input" section
- Select C922 microphone
- Speak - watch the volume meter
- **If meter moves, microphone is working** (even if LED is off)

## 💡 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Buds Still Don't Appear After Refresh

**Possible Causes:**
1. Buds not fully connected yet
2. Windows hasn't recognized as audio device
3. Buds configured as output only (speakers), not input (mic)

**Solutions:**
- **Wait 5-10 seconds** after connecting, then refresh
- **Check Windows Sound Settings** → Input devices
- **Set Buds as default input** in Windows, then refresh app
- **Disconnect and reconnect** Buds, then refresh

### Issue: C922 LED Still Doesn't Light Up

**This is likely NORMAL!**

Many webcams have LEDs that are **hardware-linked to the camera (video)**, not the microphone (audio).

**Verify mic is working instead:**
1. Speak during recording
2. Check if transcription appears
3. If you see transcribed text, **mic is working!**

**Alternate test:**
- Windows Settings → System → Sound → Input
- Select C922 microphone
- Speak - watch the volume meter
- If meter moves = mic is working

### Issue: Wrong Device Selected After Refresh

The app tries to preserve your selection. If the device ID changed:
1. Manually select correct device from dropdown
2. Device IDs can change when devices connect/disconnect
