# WDM-KS Error Fixed - Josh's Buds Pro
**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üêõ The Error You Encountered

```
Error starting stream: Unexpected host error [PaErrorCode -9999]:
'WdmSyncIoctl: DeviceIoControl GLE = 0x00000490 (prop_set = {...}, prop_id = 10)'
[Windows WDM-KS error 0]
```

---

## üîç Root Cause

**The Problem:** Your Josh's Buds3 Pro appeared multiple times with different Windows audio APIs:
- **ID 2** (MME) - Works ‚úÖ
- **ID 9** (DirectSound) - Works ‚úÖ
- **ID 18** (WASAPI) - Works ‚úÖ **BEST!**
- **ID 24** (WDM-KS) - **FAILS** ‚ùå

**What Went Wrong:**
The deduplication logic was **incorrectly selecting WDM-KS** (the worst option) instead of WASAPI (the best option).

**Why WDM-KS Fails:**
- WDM-KS (Windows Driver Model - Kernel Streaming) is a **low-level professional audio API**
- Requires **special drivers**
- Often fails with Bluetooth devices
- Meant for professional audio interfaces, not consumer Bluetooth headsets
- Error code -9999 = "Unexpected host error" = driver doesn't support operation

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### Fix #1: Corrected API Priority System

**Changed priority values to be more distinct:**

```python
def _get_api_priority(self, api_name):
    if 'wasapi' in api_name_lower:
        return 100  # WASAPI - Best! Modern, reliable
    elif 'directsound' in api_name_lower:
        return 80   # DirectSound - Good compatibility
    elif 'mme' in api_name_lower:
        return 60   # MME - Basic but works
    elif 'wdm' in api_name_lower or 'ks' in api_name_lower:
        return 10   # WDM-KS - Often fails, AVOID
    else:
        return 0
```

**Before:** Priority values were too close (1-4)
**After:** Wide separation (10-100) ensures WASAPI always wins

---

### Fix #2: Better Device Name Normalization

**Problem:** WDM-KS devices have ugly names:
```
Headset (@System32\drivers\bthhfenum.sys,#2;%1 Hands-Free%0;(Josh's Buds3 Pro))
```

**Solution:** Clean up device names before deduplication:
```python
# Extract just "Headset" from the mess
base_name = device_name.split('(')[0].strip()
# Remove driver paths
for sep in ['@', '{', '[']:
    if sep in base_name:
        base_name = base_name.split(sep)[0].strip()
```

**Result:** All "Headset" devices are recognized as the same device, and the one with highest priority (WASAPI) is selected.

### Fix #3: Helpful Error Messages

**Before:**
```
Error: Unexpected host error [PaErrorCode -9999]
Try selecting a different microphone.
```

**After:**
```
WDM-KS API error detected!

The device 'Headset (Josh's Buds3 Pro)' is using WDM-KS which often fails.

Solution:
1. Click 'üîÑ Refresh' to rescan devices
2. The app will automatically select a better API (WASAPI)
3. Try recording again
