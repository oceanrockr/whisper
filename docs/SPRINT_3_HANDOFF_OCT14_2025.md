## KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

#### 1. 2 Integration Test Errors
- **Location:** `tests/test_audio_device_fallback.py` integration tests (tests 21-22)
- **Cause:** Mocking issues with `sd.InputStream` context manager
- **Symptoms:** Tests fail with AttributeError or assertion errors
- **Impact:** Low (core unit tests pass, only integration tests affected)
- **Fix:** Update mock strategy to properly handle context manager and `read()` method
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Workaround:** Run unit tests only: `pytest tests/test_audio_device_fallback.py -k "not integration"`

#### 2. ~20 E2E Test Failures
- **Location:** `tests/e2e/` directory
- **Cause:** Missing real audio files for testing
- **Symptoms:** Tests skip or fail due to missing test data
- **Impact:** Low (not blocking beta testing)
- **Fix:** Create test audio files with known content and expected transcriptions
- **Priority:** Low
- **Workaround:** Skip E2E tests: `pytest -k "not e2e"`

#### 3. Console-Only Logging for DirectSound Switch
- **Issue:** DirectSound switch only visible in console, not in GUI
- **Impact:** Low (advanced users can check console if needed)
- **User Impact:** Users won't see notification when DirectSound activates
- **Future Enhancement:** Add GUI notification toast or status bar message
- **Priority:** Low
- **Workaround:** Instruct advanced users to run from command prompt to see logs

#### 4. Mono Recording Forced
- **Issue:** Both implementations force mono recording (`channels=1`)
- **Impact:** Low (sufficient for voice transcription)
- **User Impact:** Stereo devices are downmixed to mono
- **Reasoning:** Maximum compatibility, voice transcription doesn't need stereo
- **Future Enhancement:** Add stereo option in settings for music transcription
- **Priority:** Low
- **Workaround:** None needed (mono is acceptable for voice)

### Critical Issues

**✅ NONE IDENTIFIED** - All critical issues from previous sprints have been resolved.

### Known Limitations

1. **No Device Testing Feature** - Users can't test microphone before recording
2. **No GUI DirectSound Indicator** - Switch only visible in console
3. **Limited API Selection** - Can't manually choose WASAPI vs DirectSound
4. **No Performance Profiling** - Startup and transcription times not optimized

---

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT FOR NEW SESSION

### DirectSound Fallback Logic

**Pseudo-Code of Fallback Mechanism:**
```python
# Step 1: Query selected device information
device_info = sd.query_devices(selected_device_id, kind='input')
device_name = device_info['name']

# Step 2: Extract base name (remove API suffix)
base_name = device_name.split('(')[0].strip()
# Example: "Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) (WASAPI)" → "Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)"

# Step 3: Iterate through all devices
for device_id, device in enumerate(sd.query_devices()):
    # Step 4: Check if device has input channels
    if device['max_input_channels'] > 0:
        # Extract base name from this device
        device_base = device['name'].split('(')[0].strip()

        # Query host API name
        hostapi = sd.query_hostapis()[device['hostapi']]['name']

        # Step 5: Match base name and check if DirectSound
        if device_base == base_name and 'DirectSound' in hostapi:
            # FOUND DirectSound version!
            device_spec = device_id
            print(f"SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND: Using device ID {device_id}...")
            break

# Step 6: If no match found, use original device (graceful fallback)
if device_spec is None:
    device_spec = selected_device_id
    print("Using selected device (no DirectSound version found)")
```

**Key Principles:**
1. **Base Name Matching:** Strips API suffix to match devices across APIs
2. **API Preference:** DirectSound preferred over WASAPI for USB devices
3. **Graceful Fallback:** Uses original device if no DirectSound available
4. **Logging:** Always logs decision for debugging

### Device Selection Architectures

**Three Different Architectures:**

#### Architecture 1: veleron_voice_flow.py (User Dropdown Selection)
```python
# User selects device from dropdown
self.selected_device = dropdown_selection

# Fallback uses user's selection
device_spec = self.selected_device

# Search for DirectSound version
for i, device in enumerate(sd.query_devices()):
    if matches_base_name and is_directsound:
        device_spec = i  # Override with DirectSound
```

#### Architecture 2: veleron_dictation.py (System Default Device)
```python
# Uses system default input device
default_device_id = sd.default.device[0]

# Fallback uses default device
device_spec = None  # None means "use default"

# Search for DirectSound version of default device
for i, device in enumerate(sd.query_devices()):
    if matches_default_base_name and is_directsound:
        device_spec = i  # Override with DirectSound
```

#### Architecture 3: veleron_dictation_v2.py (User Dropdown Selection)
```python
# User selects device from dropdown (same as Architecture 1)
self.selected_device = dropdown_selection

# Fallback uses user's selection
device_spec = self.selected_device

# Search for DirectSound version
for i, device in enumerate(sd.query_devices()):
    if matches_base_name and is_directsound:
        device_spec = i  # Override with DirectSound
```

**Architectural Differences:**
- **veleron_voice_flow.py:** Logs to GUI (`self.log()`) and console
- **veleron_dictation.py:** Logs to console only (`print()`)
- **veleron_dictation_v2.py:** Logs to console only (`print()`)

### Testing Infrastructure

**Pytest Configuration:**
- **Version:** pytest 8.4.2
- **Plugins:** pytest-cov 7.0.0, anyio 4.11.0
- **Config File:** `pytest.ini` (in project root)
- **Coverage:** coverage 7.10.7

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Navigate to tests directory
cd "C:\Users\noelj\Projects\Veleron Dev Studios\Applications\whisper\tests"

# Run all tests with verbose output
py -m pytest -v

# Run specific test file
py -m pytest tests/test_audio_device_fallback.py -v

# Run with coverage report
py -m pytest --cov=. tests/

# Run tests matching pattern
py -m pytest -k "directsound" -v

# Run unit tests only (skip integration/E2E)
py -m pytest -k "not integration and not e2e" -v
```

**Mock-Based Testing:**
- No real hardware needed for unit tests
- Tests execute in <1 second
- Isolated and reproducible
- 3 reusable fixtures:
  - `mock_devices_with_directsound` (13 devices)
  - `mock_devices_no_directsound` (3 devices)
  - `mock_devices_complex_names` (6 devices)

## CONFIDENCE SCORING FRAMEWORK

### Overview

For ALL changes in Sprint 3, use this confidence scoring framework to prevent over-confidence and ensure quality decisions.

### Scoring Methodology

**Before implementing ANY change, calculate confidence score:**

```
CONFIDENCE: X%

Reasoning: [Brief explanation]

Scoring factors:
- Documentation available (30%)
- Similar patterns in codebase (25%)
- Data flow understanding (20%)
- Complexity assessment (15%)
- Impact analysis (10%)
```

### Action by Score

- **≥95% confidence:** Implement immediately, document reasoning
- **90-94% confidence:** Implement with noted uncertainties, add extra logging
- **<90% confidence:** STOP - Present multiple-choice options to user

### Example: Hardware Testing

```
CONFIDENCE: 75% - Hardware testing with real devices

Reasoning:
- Documentation: 30% (HARDWARE_TESTING_GUIDE.md exists and comprehensive)
- Similar patterns: 15% (no prior hardware testing in project, relying on mocks)
- Data flow: 20% (DirectSound fallback logic thoroughly understood)
- Complexity: 10% (device availability uncertain, real hardware behavior unknown)
- Impact: 10% (critical path item, blocking beta testing)

TOTAL: 85% (Below 90% threshold)

Below 90% because: Real hardware behavior may differ from mocks, device availability uncertain

Options:
A: Test with C922 webcam first - Best if: webcam available
B: Test with Bluetooth headset first - Best if: no webcam available
C: Virtual device testing - Best if: no hardware available
D: Delay hardware testing - Best if: waiting for hardware delivery

Which approach do you prefer?
```

### Example: Integration Test Fix

```
CONFIDENCE: 92% - Fix integration test mocking issues

Reasoning:
- Documentation: 25% (pytest mocking docs available, test code visible)
- Similar patterns: 25% (similar mock patterns in other test files)
- Data flow: 20% (understand sd.InputStream context manager)
- Complexity: 12% (mocking context managers is well-documented)
- Impact: 10% (low impact, isolated to test file)

TOTAL: 92% (Above 90%, can implement with noted uncertainties)

Uncertainties:
- Mock.read() return value format (will verify with print statements)
- Potential side effects on other tests (will run full suite)

Proceeding with implementation, extra validation steps added.
```

### Example: Beta Package Creation

```
CONFIDENCE: 88% - Create beta package ZIP file

Reasoning:
- Documentation: 25% (packaging docs available, requirements.txt exists)
- Similar patterns: 20% (no prior packaging in project)
- Data flow: 18% (file structure understood)
- Complexity: 15% (straightforward file bundling)
- Impact: 10% (critical for beta distribution)

TOTAL: 88% (Below 90% threshold)

Below 90% because: Uncertain about Windows-specific dependencies, installation on clean system

Options:
A: Create basic ZIP (apps + requirements.txt) - Best if: quick beta distribution
B: Create installer (using PyInstaller) - Best if: user-friendly installation needed
C: Create both ZIP and installer - Best if: maximum flexibility
D: Test on VM first - Best if: ensuring compatibility is priority

Which approach do you prefer?
```

### Confidence Scoring Checklist

Before implementing any change:
- [ ] Calculate confidence score using 5 factors
- [ ] Document reasoning
- [ ] If <90%, present options to user
- [ ] If ≥90%, proceed with implementation
- [ ] Note uncertainties for scores 90-94%
- [ ] Add extra validation for lower scores

## TWO-PHASE WORKFLOW (Required for ALL Fixes)

### Overview

Every fix, change, or implementation MUST follow this two-phase workflow to ensure quality and reduce regressions.

### PHASE 1: ANALYZE

**Before writing ANY code, present analysis:**

```markdown
ANALYSIS

Issue: [What's broken or what needs to be implemented]
Evidence: [Error messages, logs, test failures, user reports]
Location: [File name, function name, line numbers]
Root Cause: [Underlying problem causing the issue]
Recommended Fix: [Approach to fix, including alternatives considered]
Risk: [Potential issues, side effects, regressions]

CONFIDENCE: X%
[Reasoning using confidence scoring framework]

AWAITING APPROVAL - Proceed with implementation?
```

**User Response:** "Yes, proceed" or "No, try different approach" or "Option B"

### PHASE 2: IMPLEMENT

**After approval, implement with tests first:**

```markdown
IMPLEMENTATION

TESTS (write first):
1. Unit test: [Test specific function]
2. Edge case test: [Test boundaries]
3. Regression test: [Original bug scenario]

[Code for tests]

IMPLEMENTATION:
[The actual fix/implementation]

VALIDATION:
- [ ] All new tests pass
- [ ] No regressions (existing tests still pass)
- [ ] Manual verification (if applicable)
```

### Example: Integration Test Fix

**PHASE 1: ANALYZE**

```markdown
ANALYSIS

Issue: 2 integration tests failing in test_audio_device_fallback.py
Evidence:
  - tests 21-22 fail with AttributeError: 'Mock' object has no attribute '__enter__'
  - Error occurs when mocking sd.InputStream
Location: tests/test_audio_device_fallback.py, lines 950-980
Root Cause: Mock doesn't implement context manager protocol (__enter__, __exit__)
Recommended Fix:
  - Use MagicMock instead of Mock (has context manager support)
  - OR manually implement __enter__ and __exit__ on mock
  - OR use @patch with context manager support
Risk:
  - Low (isolated to test file)
  - Potential: Mock behavior might differ from real sd.InputStream

CONFIDENCE: 92%
Reasoning:
- Documentation: 25% (pytest mocking docs, MagicMock docs)
- Similar patterns: 25% (other tests use MagicMock)
- Data flow: 20% (understand context manager protocol)
- Complexity: 12% (well-documented pattern)
- Impact: 10% (isolated to test file)

AWAITING APPROVAL - Proceed with MagicMock approach?
```

**PHASE 2: IMPLEMENT**

```python
IMPLEMENTATION

TESTS (write first):
1. Unit test: Verify MagicMock supports context manager
2. Edge case test: Verify mock.read() returns expected format
3. Regression test: Original integration test scenario

# New test to verify mock setup
def test_mock_stream_context_manager():
    """Verify MagicMock properly implements context manager for sd.InputStream."""
    mock_stream = MagicMock()

    # Should support context manager
    with mock_stream as stream:
        assert stream is not None

    # Should support read() method
    mock_stream.read.return_value = (np.zeros((1000, 1), dtype=np.float32), False)
    data, overflowed = mock_stream.read(1000)
    assert data.shape == (1000, 1)
    assert overflowed is False

IMPLEMENTATION:

# Fix in test_audio_device_fallback.py, line 955
@patch('sounddevice.InputStream')
def test_fallback_with_mock_stream_creation(self, mock_InputStream, mock_devices_with_directsound):
    # Change from Mock to MagicMock
    mock_stream = MagicMock()  # Changed from Mock()
    mock_stream.read.return_value = (np.zeros((1000, 1), dtype=np.float32), False)

    # MagicMock automatically supports context manager
    mock_InputStream.return_value = mock_stream

    # Rest of test remains unchanged
    # ...

VALIDATION:
- [x] test_mock_stream_context_manager passes
- [x] test_fallback_with_mock_stream_creation passes
- [x] test_no_fallback_when_directsound_unavailable passes
- [x] No regressions (all 20 unit tests still pass)
- [x] Manual verification: pytest tests/test_audio_device_fallback.py -v
```

### Two-Phase Workflow Checklist

For every implementation:
- [ ] PHASE 1: Write analysis
- [ ] Wait for user approval
- [ ] PHASE 2: Write tests FIRST
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Validate all tests pass
- [ ] Check for regressions

---

## MANDATORY TEST STRUCTURE

### Overview

Every fix or implementation requires three types of tests to ensure quality and prevent regressions.

### Three Required Tests

1. **Unit Test** - Tests the specific function or component
2. **Edge Case Test** - Tests boundaries, unusual inputs, error conditions
3. **Regression Test** - Tests the original bug scenario to prevent re-occurrence

### Example: DirectSound Fallback Test

```python
# 1. UNIT TEST - Core functionality
def test_directsound_switch_success():
    """Unit test: Verify DirectSound switch for matching base name."""
    # Arrange: Setup mock devices with DirectSound option
    devices = [
        {'name': 'Mic (C922) (WASAPI)', 'max_input_channels': 2, 'hostapi': 0},
        {'name': 'Mic (C922) (DirectSound)', 'max_input_channels': 2, 'hostapi': 1}
    ]
    hostapis = [
        {'name': 'Windows WASAPI'},
        {'name': 'Windows DirectSound'}
    ]

    # Act: Run fallback logic
    selected_device = 0  # WASAPI device
    device_spec = find_directsound_device(selected_device, devices, hostapis)

    # Assert: Should switch to DirectSound (device 1)
    assert device_spec == 1

# 2. EDGE CASE TEST - Boundary conditions
def test_directsound_switch_no_directsound_available():
    """Edge case: No DirectSound version available."""
    # Arrange: Setup mock devices WITHOUT DirectSound
    devices = [
        {'name': 'Mic (C922) (WASAPI)', 'max_input_channels': 2, 'hostapi': 0}
    ]
    hostapis = [
        {'name': 'Windows WASAPI'}
    ]

    # Act: Run fallback logic
    selected_device = 0
    device_spec = find_directsound_device(selected_device, devices, hostapis)

    # Assert: Should fallback to original device
    assert device_spec == 0  # No switch, graceful fallback

# 3. REGRESSION TEST - Original bug scenario
def test_directsound_prevents_wdm_ks_error():
    """Regression test: Verify WDM-KS error prevented by DirectSound."""
    # Arrange: Setup scenario that previously caused WDM-KS error
    # C922 webcam with WASAPI API (used to fail with error -9999)
    devices = [
        {'name': 'Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) (WASAPI)', 'max_input_channels': 2, 'hostapi': 0},
        {'name': 'Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) (DirectSound)', 'max_input_channels': 2, 'hostapi': 1}
    ]
    hostapis = [
        {'name': 'Windows WASAPI'},
        {'name': 'Windows DirectSound'}
    ]

    # Act: Run fallback logic (should switch to DirectSound)
    selected_device = 0  # WASAPI (would fail with WDM-KS)
    device_spec = find_directsound_device(selected_device, devices, hostapis)

    # Assert: Should switch to DirectSound (prevents error)
    assert device_spec == 1  # DirectSound device

    # Additional assertion: Verify this would work with real sd.InputStream
    # (in real code, this would call sd.InputStream with device_spec=1)
```

### Test Structure Template

```python
describe('Fix: [Issue name]', () => {
  it('should [core functionality]', () => {
    # Arrange: Setup test data
    # Act: Call function
    # Assert: Verify expected behavior
  });

  it('should handle [edge case]', () => {
    # Boundary test
  });

  it('should not regress [original bug]', () => {
    # Original failing case
  });
});
```

### Mandatory Test Checklist

For every implementation:
- [ ] Unit test written (core functionality)
- [ ] Edge case test written (boundaries)
- [ ] Regression test written (original bug)
- [ ] All three tests pass
- [ ] Tests added to appropriate test file
- [ ] Tests documented with clear docstrings

## NEW SESSION STARTUP PROMPT

### For the next development session, use this prompt:

```markdown
I'm continuing Sprint 3 of the Veleron Whisper Voice-to-Text MVP project.

**Context:**
- Sprint 2 completed successfully (100% MVP complete, 233% efficiency)
- DirectSound fallback implemented in all 3 recording apps
- 334 tests created (87% pass rate, 100% DirectSound tests passing)
- All security vulnerabilities fixed (3 CRITICAL, 4 HIGH)
- Ready for hardware testing and beta deployment

**Sprint 3 Objectives:**
1. **Priority 1 (CRITICAL):** Hardware testing with USB devices (C922 webcam, Bluetooth/USB headsets)
2. **Priority 2 (MEDIUM):** Fix 2 integration test errors in test_audio_device_fallback.py
3. **Priority 3 (LOW):** Create beta testing package and feedback system
4. **Priority 4 (LOW):** Update documentation (README, compatibility list, known issues)

**Please:**
1. Read the handoff document: @docs/SPRINT_3_HANDOFF_OCT14_2025.md
2. Review hardware testing guide: @docs/HARDWARE_TESTING_GUIDE.md
3. Check current project status: @docs/SPRINT_2_COMPLETION_OCT14_2025.md
4. Begin Sprint 3 by deploying RiPIT workflow subagents as outlined in the handoff

**Critical:**
- Use confidence scoring framework (≥95% implement, <90% ask)
- Follow two-phase workflow (analyze then implement)
- Write tests before implementing fixes (unit, edge case, regression)
- Deploy subagents for parallel execution (Subagents 1, 2, 4 parallel; Subagent 3 depends on 1)

**Hardware Testing Priority:**
Let's start with hardware testing first, following the HARDWARE_TESTING_GUIDE.md procedures. The primary test case is the C922 webcam (or similar USB webcam), which previously failed with WDM-KS errors. We need to verify that the DirectSound fallback mechanism works correctly with real hardware.

**Question:** Do you have access to a USB webcam (ideally C922, but any USB webcam will work) or Bluetooth headset for testing?

If yes → Proceed with hardware testing (Priority 1)
If no → Start with integration test fixes (Priority 2) or documentation (Priority 4) while arranging hardware

Which path should we take?
```

## LESSONS LEARNED (Carry Forward)

### From Sprint 2

#### Technical Lessons

1. **RiPIT Workflow Delivers 233% Efficiency**
   - Subagent deployment enables parallel execution
   - Specialization improves code quality
   - Lesson: Always deploy subagents for complex sprints
   - Application: Use Subagents 1-4 in Sprint 3 for parallel work

2. **Mock-Based Testing Is Fast and Reliable**
   - 22 DirectSound tests execute in <1 second
   - No hardware dependencies
   - Isolated and reproducible
   - Lesson: Mock external dependencies (audio devices, files, network)
   - Application: Create mock fixtures for hardware tests even though using real devices

3. **Document During Development**
   - Writing docs while coding captures context
   - Fresh understanding leads to better documentation
   - Reduces post-development documentation burden
   - Lesson: Document as you code, not after
   - Application: Document hardware test results immediately after each test

4. **DirectSound More Reliable Than WASAPI**
   - WASAPI fails with WDM-KS errors on consumer USB devices
   - DirectSound works consistently
   - Performance difference negligible for voice transcription
   - Lesson: Use DirectSound for USB devices, WASAPI for built-in
   - Application: Verify DirectSound switch in hardware testing

5. **Confidence Scoring Prevents Over-Confidence**
   - Calculating confidence before implementing reduces errors
   - Presenting options at <90% improves decision quality
   - Extra validation at 90-94% catches edge cases
   - Lesson: Always calculate confidence score before implementing
   - Application: Use confidence scoring for all Sprint 3 changes

#### Process Lessons

6. **Automated Testing Saves Time**
   - 22 tests execute in <1 second vs hours of manual testing
   - Regression detection prevents re-introducing bugs
   - Continuous integration becomes feasible
   - Lesson: Write tests before manual testing
   - Application: Fix integration tests early in Sprint 3

7. **UTF-8 Compliance Is Non-Negotiable**
   - Python 3.13 strictly enforces UTF-8
   - Test data with special characters must use proper escapes
   - Encoding issues break entire test suite
   - Lesson: Always save files as UTF-8, validate encoding
   - Application: Verify all new files are UTF-8 compliant

8. **Backup Before Risky Changes**
   - Created backups before modifying apps
   - Easy rollback if issues arise
   - Minimal storage cost, maximum safety
   - Lesson: Always create backups for production code changes
   - Application: Create backups before any fixes in Sprint 3

9. **Console Logging Is Valuable for Debugging**
   - "SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND" message crucial for verification
   - Users can verify fallback is working
   - Advanced users appreciate transparency
   - Lesson: Log important decisions, not just errors
   - Application: Monitor console logs during hardware testing

10. **Reusing Code Accelerates Development**
    - DirectSound fallback from veleron_voice_flow.py adapted to other apps
    - Understanding established patterns speeds implementation
    - Consistency across codebase improves maintainability
    - Lesson: Identify reusable patterns and document them
    - Application: Reuse testing patterns from HARDWARE_TESTING_GUIDE.md

## FINAL NOTES

### Why Sprint 3 Is CRITICAL

**Sprint 3 represents the transition from development to production:**

1. **First Real Hardware Validation**
   - MVP works with mocked devices, but real hardware may behave differently
   - DirectSound fallback effectiveness unknown until tested
   - Hardware compatibility determines market readiness

2. **Beta Testing Establishes User Confidence**
   - First external validation of MVP
   - Real user feedback drives final improvements
   - Beta testers become early adopters and advocates

3. **Hardware Compatibility Determines Market Readiness**
   - If DirectSound works with diverse devices → Ready for production
   - If limited compatibility → Need additional development
   - Compatibility matrix informs marketing and support

4. **Feedback Loop Begins**
   - User feedback → Developer improvements → Better product
   - Establishes iterative development process
   - Validates product-market fit
