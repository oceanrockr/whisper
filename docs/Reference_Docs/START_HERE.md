## üöÄ Starting Sprint 3 - Use This Prompt

**Once you've completed the checklist above, start your new session with this exact prompt:**

```markdown
I'm continuing Sprint 3 of the Veleron Whisper Voice-to-Text MVP project.

**Context:**
- Sprint 2 completed successfully (100% MVP complete)
- DirectSound fallback implemented in all 3 recording apps
- 334 tests created (87% pass rate)
- Ready for hardware testing and beta deployment

**Sprint 3 Objectives (in priority order):**
1. PRIORITY 1: Hardware testing with USB devices (C922 webcam, Bluetooth/USB headsets)
2. PRIORITY 2: Fix 2 integration test errors in test_audio_device_fallback.py
3. PRIORITY 3: Create beta testing package and feedback system
4. PRIORITY 4: Update documentation (README, compatibility list, known issues)

**I have read:**
‚úÖ docs/Reference_Docs/CORE_DEVELOPMENT_PRINCIPLES.md (confidence scoring, two-phase workflow, test structure)
‚úÖ docs/Reference_Docs/SPRINT_3_HANDOFF_OCT14_2025.md (complete handoff, RiPIT deployment)
‚úÖ docs/Reference_Docs/HARDWARE_TESTING_GUIDE.md (10 hardware tests documented)

**Please:**
1. Confirm you've read these reference docs
2. Begin Sprint 3 by deploying RiPIT workflow subagents per SPRINT_3_HANDOFF Section 9
3. Start with PRIORITY 1: Hardware testing following HARDWARE_TESTING_GUIDE procedures

**Critical framework to follow:**
- Use confidence scoring framework (‚â•95% implement, <90% ask)
- Follow two-phase workflow (analyze then implement)
- Write tests before implementing fixes
- Deploy subagents for parallel execution

**Hardware available for testing:**
[Tell the agent which hardware you have: C922 webcam? Bluetooth headset? USB headset? Built-in mic only?]

Let's start with hardware testing first per HARDWARE_TESTING_GUIDE.md Test 1-3.
```
