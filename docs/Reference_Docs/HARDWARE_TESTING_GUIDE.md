# Hardware Testing Guide - Veleron Whisper Voice-to-Text
**DirectSound Fallback Verification**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Testing
**Purpose:** Verify DirectSound fallback works with real hardware

---

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the DirectSound fallback mechanism with actual USB audio devices. The goal is to verify that the automatic API switching works correctly with real hardware, not just mocked devices.

**What We're Testing:**
- DirectSound fallback activates automatically with USB devices
- Console logs show "SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND" message
- Recording works without WDM-KS errors
- Audio quality is acceptable
- All three recording applications function correctly

---

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Required

**Minimum (Must Have):**
- ‚úÖ 1 USB webcam with microphone (e.g., Logitech C922 Pro Stream Webcam)
  - This is the primary test case as it previously failed with WDM-KS errors

**Recommended (Should Have):**
- ‚úÖ 1 Bluetooth headset (e.g., Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro, AirPods, etc.)
- ‚úÖ 1 USB headset (gaming or conference headset)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 USB microphone (Blue Yeti, Rode NT-USB, etc.)

**Optional (Nice to Have):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è USB audio interface (Focusrite Scarlett, etc.)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple USB webcams (to test device switching)

### Software Required

- ‚úÖ Python 3.13.7 (installed)
- ‚úÖ All dependencies installed (openai-whisper, sounddevice, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Applications patched with DirectSound fallback (Oct 14, 2025)
- ‚úÖ Console window access (to view logs)

### Setup
1. **Connect USB webcam** (e.g., C922)
2. **Wait 10 seconds** for Windows to recognize device
3. **Open Command Prompt** (not PowerShell)

### Execution
```bash
cd "c:\Users\noelj\Projects\Veleron Dev Studios\Applications\whisper"
py veleron_voice_flow.py
```

### Expected Behavior

**On Application Launch:**
```
[2025-10-14 HH:MM:SS] [INFO] Checking ffmpeg availability...
[2025-10-14 HH:MM:SS] [INFO] Found ffmpeg at: C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin
[2025-10-14 HH:MM:SS] [INFO] Scanning for audio input devices...
[2025-10-14 HH:MM:SS] [INFO] Found input device 12: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) (Windows WASAPI, 2 channels)
```

**When You Start Recording:**
1. Select "Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Web... (WASAPI)" from dropdown
2. Click "Start Recording" button
3. **Watch console for this log:**

```
[2025-10-14 HH:MM:SS] [INFO] Starting recording...
[2025-10-14 HH:MM:SS] [INFO] Recording from device 12: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)
[2025-10-14 HH:MM:SS] [INFO] Device has 2 input channels
[2025-10-14 HH:MM:SS] [INFO] Current selection: Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam) (ID: 12, API: Windows WASAPI)
[2025-10-14 HH:MM:SS] [INFO] SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND: Using device ID 6 (Microphone (C922 Pro Stream Webcam)) instead of 12
```

**Key Indicator:** Look for **"SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND"** message!

4. Speak for 5-10 seconds: "This is a test of the DirectSound fallback mechanism."
5. Click "Stop Recording"
6. Wait for transcription to complete

### Success Criteria

‚úÖ **PASS** if:

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND" never appears

**Possible Causes:**
1. Device doesn't have DirectSound version (check Windows Sound Settings)
2. DirectSound driver not installed
3. Fallback code not running

**Solution:**
1. Check if device appears in Windows Sound Settings with "Windows DirectSound" suffix
2. Verify fallback code is present (check line numbers in report)
3. Try a different USB device

---

### Issue: WDM-KS Error Still Occurs

**Error Message:**
```
Error starting stream: Unexpected host error [PaErrorCode -9999]:
'WdmSyncIoctl: DeviceIoControl GLE = 0x00000490'
```

**This is a CRITICAL BUG** - DirectSound fallback failed!

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Document everything:**
   - Device model
   - Device ID
   - Console logs
   - Screenshot of error
2. **Check fallback code:**
   - Verify lines 580-618 present in veleron_voice_flow.py
   - Verify lines 394-464 present in veleron_dictation.py
   - Verify lines 338-415 present in veleron_dictation_v2.py
3. **Report bug** with documentation

---

### Issue: No Audio Captured (Silent Recording)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Microphone muted in Windows
2. Wrong device selected
3. Permission denied

**Solution:**
1. **Check Windows Sound Settings:**
   - Speak and watch input level meter
   - Ensure microphone not muted
   - Set microphone as default device
2. **Check Windows Privacy Settings:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone
   - Enable "Microphone access"
   - Enable for Python
3. **Try Refresh button** to rescan devices
4. **Restart application**

---

### Issue: Application Crashes During Recording

**If this happens:**
