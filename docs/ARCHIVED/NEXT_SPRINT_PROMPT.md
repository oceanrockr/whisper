# Sprint Handoff Prompt - Veleron Whisper Voice-to-Text MVP
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Status:** MVP Complete - Ready for Final App Patches & Beta Testing
**Session:** Sprint 2 - DirectSound Implementation & Production Deployment

---

## Executive Summary

The Veleron Whisper Voice-to-Text MVP is **100% complete** for the primary application (`veleron_voice_flow.py`). All critical security vulnerabilities have been patched, comprehensive unit tests written (84 tests, 100% passing), and a **critical audio API bug has been resolved**.

**CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH:** Resolved WDM-KS audio API error that was blocking production deployment. The C922 Pro Stream Webcam (and likely other USB audio devices) was failing with "WdmSyncIoctl: DeviceIoControl GLE = 0x00000490" errors despite being correctly selected as a WASAPI device. **Solution:** Automatic DirectSound fallback implemented in `veleron_voice_flow.py` (lines 580-618).

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Apply DirectSound fallback to `veleron_dictation.py` and `veleron_dictation_v2.py`
2. Test all three applications with C922 webcam
3. Begin beta testing program

---

## Your Mission for This Sprint

As the project manager/architect, you need to:

1. **Apply the DirectSound Fix** to the remaining 2 applications
2. **Verify all apps work** with the C922 webcam (the hardware that exposed the bug)
3. **Setup beta testing** program with 5-10 users
4. **Monitor production deployment** and collect feedback

Use the BMAD workflow: Deploy subagents as needed, implement MCPs, and recursively delegate tasks until completion.

---

## Critical Context: The WDM-KS Problem & Solution

### What Happened

During production testing, the C922 Pro Stream Webcam failed with this error:

```
Error starting stream: Unanticipated host error [PaErrorCode -9999]:
'WdmSyncIoctl: DeviceIoControl GLE = 0x00000490 (prop_set = {...}, prop_id = 10)'
[Windows WDM-KS error 0]
```

### Why It Happened

- The webcam reports as a **WASAPI** device during enumeration
- When sounddevice opens the audio stream, Windows **internally falls back to WDM-KS**
- Consumer USB devices (like webcams) lack proper WDM-KS IOCTL support
- Result: Stream opening fails with cryptic kernel-level error

### The Solution (WORKING!)

Before opening the audio stream, automatically detect WASAPI devices and switch to their DirectSound equivalent:

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Try using DirectSound instead of WASAPI
# USB devices report as WASAPI but fail with WDM-KS errors
# DirectSound is more reliable for USB devices

device_spec = self.selected_device
selected_base_name = None

# Get the base name of currently selected device
for device in self.audio_devices:
    if device['id'] == self.selected_device:
        selected_base_name = device['name'].split('(')[0].strip()
        self.log(f"Current selection: {device['name']} (ID: {device['id']}, API: {device['hostapi_name']})")
        break

# Try to find DirectSound version of the same device
if selected_base_name:
    for i, full_device in enumerate(sd.query_devices()):
        if full_device['max_input_channels'] > 0:
            full_name = full_device['name'].strip()
            full_base = full_name.split('(')[0].strip()
            hostapi = sd.query_hostapis()[full_device['hostapi']]['name']

            if full_base == selected_base_name and 'DirectSound' in hostapi:
                device_spec = i
                self.log(f"SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND: Using device ID {i} ({full_name}) instead of {self.selected_device}")
                device_channels = full_device['max_input_channels']
                break

# Use device_spec (not self.selected_device) in stream opening
with sd.InputStream(
    device=device_spec,
    samplerate=self.sample_rate,
    channels=device_channels,
    dtype=np.float32,
    callback=callback
):
    # ... recording logic
```

**Location:** `veleron_voice_flow.py` lines 580-618 in the `start_recording()` method

**User Confirmation:** "perfect! all working now!"

## Code Snippet: DirectSound Fallback (Copy This)

Here's the exact code you need to add to `veleron_dictation.py` and `veleron_dictation_v2.py`:

```python
def start_recording(self):
    """Start recording audio with DirectSound fallback for USB devices"""

    # ... existing setup code ...

    # CRITICAL FIX: DirectSound fallback for WASAPI devices
    device_spec = self.selected_device  # or your device variable name
    device_channels = 1  # or your channels variable

    # Get the base name of currently selected device
    selected_base_name = None
    device_info = sd.query_devices(self.selected_device)
    if device_info:
        selected_base_name = device_info['name'].split('(')[0].strip()
        hostapi = sd.query_hostapis()[device_info['hostapi']]['name']
        print(f"[INFO] Current selection: {device_info['name']} (ID: {self.selected_device}, API: {hostapi})")

    # Try to find DirectSound version of the same device
    if selected_base_name:
        for i, full_device in enumerate(sd.query_devices()):
            if full_device['max_input_channels'] > 0:
                full_name = full_device['name'].strip()
                full_base = full_name.split('(')[0].strip()
                hostapi = sd.query_hostapis()[full_device['hostapi']]['name']

                if full_base == selected_base_name and 'DirectSound' in hostapi:
                    device_spec = i
                    device_channels = full_device['max_input_channels']
                    print(f"[INFO] SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND: Using device ID {i} ({full_name}) instead of {self.selected_device}")
                    break

    # Open stream with device_spec (which might be DirectSound now)
    with sd.InputStream(
        device=device_spec,  # Use device_spec, not self.selected_device
        samplerate=self.sample_rate,
        channels=device_channels,
        dtype=np.float32,
        callback=callback
    ):
        # ... existing recording loop ...
```

**Key Points:**
1. Replace `self.selected_device` with appropriate variable name for each file
2. Add this logic **before** the `sd.InputStream()` call
3. Use `device_spec` (not original device ID) in the stream
4. Keep the logging messages for debugging

## How to Use This Prompt

### Starting Your Session

1. **Read this prompt completely** (yes, all of it - it's your roadmap)

2. **Read the audio troubleshooting guide:**
   ```
   @docs/AUDIO_API_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
   ```
   This contains all the technical details about the WDM-KS issue.

3. **Read the latest sprint handoff:**
   ```
   @docs/SPRINT_HANDOFF_OCT13_2025.md
   ```

4. **Verify current status:**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\noelj\Projects\Veleron Dev Studios\Applications\whisper"
   py verify_security_fixes.py
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```
   Both should be 100% passing.

5. **Start with Task 1:** Apply DirectSound fix to `veleron_dictation.py`

### Working Through Tasks

For each task:
1. Read the relevant file
2. Locate the audio stream opening code
3. Apply the DirectSound fallback logic
4. Test with C922 webcam
5. Verify console shows "SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND"
6. Run unit tests to ensure nothing broke
7. Document the changes

### Using Subagents (BMAD Workflow)

Deploy subagents as needed:
- **code-writer**: Apply DirectSound fix to files
- **test-runner**: Run unit tests and verify results
- **documentation-writer**: Update docs with test results
- **general-purpose**: Research any issues that arise

Run subagents in parallel when possible to maximize efficiency.

### When You Get Stuck

1. **Check logs:** Console output shows what's actually happening
2. **Reference docs:** `AUDIO_API_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` has all debugging attempts documented
3. **Test iteratively:** Make small changes, test immediately
4. **Ask for help:** If truly stuck, ask user for hardware logs

---

## Critical Success Factors

### This Sprint Will Succeed If:
1. ‚úÖ All 3 apps work with C922 webcam (the device that exposed the bug)
2. ‚úÖ No WDM-KS errors occur during normal operation
3. ‚úÖ Beta testers can install and run apps successfully
4. ‚úÖ No security regressions (all tests still pass)

### This Sprint Will Fail If:
1. ‚ùå WDM-KS errors still occur with C922
2. ‚ùå DirectSound fallback breaks other devices
3. ‚ùå Security tests fail after changes
4. ‚ùå Beta testers can't get apps working

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk:** DirectSound breaks working devices
  **Mitigation:** Only switch to DirectSound for WASAPI devices, keep fallback optional

- **Risk:** Beta testers have different hardware issues
  **Mitigation:** Collect detailed logs, support multiple audio APIs

- **Risk:** Changes break security patches
  **Mitigation:** Run full test suite after every change

---

## Questions You Might Have

### Q: Why DirectSound instead of fixing WASAPI?
**A:** WASAPI's internal WDM-KS fallback is part of Windows, not our code. We can't fix it. DirectSound doesn't have this fallback, making it more reliable for USB devices.

### Q: Will this work with all USB devices?
**A:** Unknown. It works with C922. Beta testing will reveal compatibility with other devices. That's why we're testing with diverse hardware.

### Q: What if DirectSound also fails?
**A:** We have MME as a last resort. The priority is: DirectSound > MME > WASAPI (for USB). The code can be extended to try multiple fallbacks.

### Q: Should I modify whisper_to_office.py too?
**A:** Not immediately. It's a CLI tool without interactive device selection. Focus on the 3 main apps first. Add to backlog for later.

### Q: How do I know if DirectSound is being used?
**A:** Check console output. You'll see: `"[INFO] SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND: Using device ID X (Device Name) instead of Y"`
