## Using with Microsoft Office

### Microsoft Word

**Best For:** Long-form documents, reports, letters, articles

**Tips:**
- Dictate one paragraph at a time (15-30 seconds per recording)

**Example Workflow:**
```
1. Open Word document
2. Click where you want to start typing
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Space
4. "This is the introduction paragraph. It explains the main topic.
   We will cover three key points in this document."

## Best Practices

### For Best Accuracy

1. **Use a good microphone**
   - USB microphones work best
   - Webcam microphones work well (like Logitech C922)
   - Bluetooth headsets may have latency issues

2. **Speak clearly and naturally**
   - Don't shout or whisper
   - Natural conversational pace is best
   - Pause briefly between sentences

3. **Minimize background noise**
   - Close windows to reduce street noise
   - Turn off fans or air conditioning when recording
   - Quiet room = better accuracy

4. **Optimal recording length**
   - **Best:** 5-15 seconds per recording
   - **Good:** 15-30 seconds
   - **Avoid:** Over 60 seconds (split into multiple recordings)

### Punctuation and Formatting

**Whisper AI automatically adds:**
- Periods at end of sentences
- Commas in appropriate places
- Basic capitalization

**You may need to manually add:**
- Question marks (say "question mark" or add manually)
- Exclamation points (say "exclamation point" or add manually)
- Quotation marks
- Paragraph breaks
- Bold, italics, underline formatting

### Workflow Optimization

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. **Dictate content first** (don't worry about perfect formatting)
2. **Review and edit** (check for accuracy)
3. **Format second** (apply styles, bold, italics, etc.)
4. **Proofread final** (check spelling, grammar, flow)

**Don't try to:**
- Format while dictating
- Say punctuation for every mark
- Dictate very long passages (break into chunks)

## Troubleshooting

### "Veleron Dictation is not responding"

**Solution:**
1. Check system tray - is the icon still there?
2. If missing, restart Veleron Dictation
3. Test with Notepad first (simpler app)

### "No text appears when I dictate"

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Not holding hotkey**
   - Make sure you HOLD Ctrl+Shift+Space while speaking
   - Release AFTER you finish speaking

2. **Cursor not in text field**
   - Click in your document where you want text
   - Make sure the cursor is blinking

3. **Microphone not working**
   - Test your microphone in Windows Sound Settings
   - Try refreshing devices in Veleron Voice Flow

4. **Wrong window focused**
   - Click in your Office document to make it active
   - Dictation types into the ACTIVE window only

### "Text appears in wrong location"

**Solution:**
- Always click where you want text BEFORE dictating
- Veleron Dictation types at your cursor position
- It doesn't know where you want text - you must position the cursor

### "Accuracy is poor"

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Check microphone**
   - Test in Windows Sound Settings
   - Is input level too low or too high?
   - Try a different microphone

2. **Reduce background noise**
   - Close door/window
   - Turn off fans
   - Move away from noisy computers

3. **Check microphone position**
   - Position 6-12 inches from mouth
   - Point directly at your mouth
   - Not too close (causes distortion)

4. **Try larger Whisper model**
   - Open Veleron Voice Flow
   - Change Model from "base" ‚Üí "small" or "medium"
   - Larger models = better accuracy (but slower)

### "Dictation is too slow"

**Solutions:**

1. **Use smaller Whisper model**
   - "tiny" = fastest (lower accuracy)
   - "base" = balanced (recommended)
   - "small" = slower but more accurate

2. **Close other applications**
   - Whisper requires CPU resources
   - Close Chrome, heavy apps

3. **Record shorter clips**
   - 5-10 second recordings process faster
   - Long recordings take more time
