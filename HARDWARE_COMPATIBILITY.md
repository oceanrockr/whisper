## API Compatibility Matrix

### Windows Audio API Overview

| Device Type | Recommended API | Fallback API | Known Issues |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| USB Webcams | DirectSound | WASAPI | WASAPI may fail with WDM-KS error |
| USB Headsets | DirectSound | WASAPI | WASAPI may fail with WDM-KS error |
| Bluetooth Headsets | WASAPI | DirectSound | Both work reliably |
| Built-in Microphones | WASAPI | DirectSound | WASAPI is native Windows API |
| USB Microphones | DirectSound | WASAPI | WASAPI may fail with WDM-KS error |
| Pro Audio Interfaces | WASAPI | DirectSound | Professional devices typically work with WASAPI |

### API Behavior Summary

**WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API):**
- Modern Windows audio API
- Excellent for built-in microphones
- May fail with WDM-KS errors on consumer USB devices
- Error code: -9999 (device not found)

**DirectSound:**
- Legacy Windows audio API
- Excellent compatibility with USB devices
- Reliable fallback for problematic devices
- Automatic fallback implemented in all recording apps

**Automatic Fallback Logic:**
1. Application attempts to use selected device (typically WASAPI)
2. If device has DirectSound version available, switch automatically
3. Log message: "SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND: Using device ID X..."
4. If no DirectSound version, use original device selection
5. Graceful degradation ensures recording always works

## Known Incompatible Devices

**[To be updated after hardware testing]**

No incompatible devices identified yet. Testing in progress.

**Expected Compatibility:** >95% of consumer audio devices

---

## Device Selection Guidelines

### For Best Results:

1. **USB Webcams**
   - Connect to USB 3.0 port for best performance
   - Allow DirectSound automatic fallback
   - Verify "SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND" message in console

2. **USB Headsets**
   - Use USB port directly (avoid USB hubs if possible)
   - Check Windows Sound Settings to verify device is recognized
   - Adjust microphone levels before recording

3. **Bluetooth Headsets**
   - Pair device in Windows Settings first
   - Ensure device is connected before launching application
   - May need to refresh device list after connection

4. **Built-in Microphones**
   - Usually work without configuration
   - Check Windows Sound Settings for microphone levels
   - Reduce background noise for better accuracy

5. **USB Microphones**
   - Professional microphones typically work excellently
   - Allow DirectSound automatic fallback
   - Adjust gain settings on microphone if available

## Troubleshooting Device Issues

### Device Not Listed in Dropdown?

1. **Check Windows Device Manager**
   - Open Device Manager → Audio inputs and outputs
   - Verify device is recognized by Windows
   - Check for driver warnings (yellow exclamation mark)

2. **Refresh Device List**
   - Click "Refresh" button in application
   - Disconnect and reconnect device
   - Restart application

3. **Check USB Connection**
   - Try different USB port
   - Avoid USB hubs if possible
   - Ensure USB cable is functional

### Recording Fails or Produces Silence?

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for "SWITCHING TO DIRECTSOUND" message
   - Verify no error messages during recording
   - Check for WDM-KS error (-9999)

2. **Windows Sound Settings**
   - Open Settings → Sound → Input
   - Test microphone (green bars should move when speaking)
   - Adjust microphone volume/boost

3. **Application Settings**
   - Verify correct device selected in dropdown
   - Try different audio model (medium or turbo)
   - Check recording duration isn't too short

### Audio Quality Poor?

1. **Microphone Positioning**
   - Keep microphone 6-12 inches from mouth
   - Speak clearly and at normal volume
   - Reduce background noise

2. **Device Settings**
   - Adjust microphone levels in Windows Sound Settings
   - Disable audio enhancements if enabled
   - Try disabling microphone boost

3. **Model Selection**
   - Use "medium" or "turbo" model for better accuracy
   - Larger models provide better accuracy but slower speed
   - Balance speed vs accuracy based on needs

## Performance Benchmarks

**[Pending hardware testing results]**

Performance metrics will be added after hardware testing completes:
- Startup time with different device types
- Recording latency
- Transcription time
- Audio quality comparison (WASAPI vs DirectSound)

---

## Testing Methodology

Hardware testing follows procedures outlined in:
- [docs/HARDWARE_TESTING_GUIDE.md](docs/HARDWARE_TESTING_GUIDE.md)

**Testing Procedure:**
1. Connect device to system
2. Launch application (veleron_voice_flow.py, veleron_dictation.py, or veleron_dictation_v2.py)
3. Select device from dropdown
4. Record 30-second test audio
5. Verify DirectSound switch in console logs
6. Check transcription accuracy (<5% word error rate)
7. Document results

**Test Scenarios:**
- Test 1-3: USB Webcam with all 3 recording apps
- Test 4-6: Bluetooth Headset with all 3 recording apps
- Test 7: Device hot-swap (connect mid-session)
- Test 8: Multiple device switching
- Test 9: Built-in microphone (regression test)
- Test 10: Audio quality verification
