**A production-ready voice-to-text application suite powered by OpenAI Whisper, optimized for Windows with automatic DirectSound fallback for maximum USB audio device compatibility.**

---

## üé§ USB Audio Device Support (NEW)

**Automatic DirectSound Fallback** - Veleron Whisper now automatically detects USB audio devices and switches to DirectSound API for maximum compatibility.

### What This Means for You:
- ‚úÖ USB webcams (Logitech C922, C920, etc.) - **Just work!**
- ‚úÖ USB headsets - No more "device not found" errors
- ‚úÖ Bluetooth headsets - Seamless connectivity
- ‚úÖ Built-in microphones - Still fully supported

### Previous Issue (Now Fixed):
- ‚ùå Before: USB devices failed with cryptic WDM-KS errors (-9999)
- ‚úÖ Now: Automatic API switching ensures compatibility

**You don't need to do anything** - the fallback is automatic!
